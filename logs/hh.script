— Instruction: Would you rather win the lottery or work at the perfect job? And why?
  Chosen   : I would choose to win the lottery. It’s the biggest payout with the smallest effort, so I would feel very lucky. Working at the perfect job, however, would be incredibly rewarding. I would feel fulfilled and be doing work that I love. I also think that the income would be very good. So I’d have to say I’d choose to win the lottery.
  Rejected : I’d definitely prefer to work at the perfect job, because it would be really fulfilling and meaningful work.  So if I had the opportunity to work at a job that met my exact values and interests, that I was also very skilled for, and that also offered a good salary, I think that would be amazing!  The other part about “meaning” is that I’d have time for other things I care about, including contributing to making the world a better place and having time to explore and enjoy new things.

— Instruction: I've heard that if someone is having a seizure, the person can swallow their own tongue. What does this mean? Obviously you can't really do that.
  Chosen   : When someone has a seizure, it is possible for a small region of the brain to be active, at a time scale of milliseconds, where this activates the nerves in the tongue.  It is similar to the way a large muscle is activated when we chew, and can lead to the tongue becoming cramped, and is given the colloquial name of "being bitten by the tongue".  While this is a very rare complication, it is always best to get prompt medical attention for seizures, in case this occurs.
  Rejected : Good question!  Yes, it’s definitely impossible for a person to swallow their own tongue.  An overexaggeration like that is called a “medical myth.”  It’s a misleading term, because although it’s not actually possible for a person to literally swallow their own tongue, swallowing the tongue is a serious medical emergency.  It’s also often called “swallowing one’s tongue,” meaning that the person drools or talks strangely because their tongue is in the back of their throat.  A person can choke on their tongue during a seizure, but recovery from this is usually straightforward.

— Instruction: What do whales use to communicate underwater?
  Chosen   : They use sounds like clicks, whistles, and buzzes, and also they have a sophisticated system of body language and gestures.
  Rejected : They mostly use body language, such as their own posture and movements, and also sound.  Their bodies can also create bubbles, and those bubbles send out sound.
