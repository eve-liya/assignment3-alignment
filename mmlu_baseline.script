6. Q: This question refers to the following information.
In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received.

You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."
